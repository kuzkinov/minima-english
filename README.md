## What to do if you turn off a node for a month and after turning it back on, the blocks can't catch up
- Add peers to add connections and wait. 
- https://spartacusrex.com/minimapeers.txt
- If it doesn't work, then do a full synchronization.
- Recommendation 
- If you turn off the node, make a backup
- From the backup you can quickly restore by specifying one of the hosts from the file https://spartacusrex.com/minimapeers.txt.
- The scheme works if the backup is not older than 2 months.
